bengal gold love forever skies air set heart tune flute spring mother mine fragrance mango groves makes wild joy ah thrill autumn mother mine full blossomed paddy fields seen spread sweet smiles ah beauty shades affection tenderness quilt spread feet banyan trees along banks rivers mother mine words lips like nectar ears ah thrill sadness mother mine casts gloom face eyes filled tears
